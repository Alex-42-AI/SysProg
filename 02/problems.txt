Write 2 C programs, where:
The first one opens twice a file for reading, alternatively reads from both descriptors and outputs the result on the standard output.
The second one opens a file for reading, duplicates the descriptor, alternatively reads several times from both descriptors and outputs the result on the standard output. It closes the original descriptor and continues reading from the duplicated one.
Is there a difference in the execution of both programs? If so, what is it and why?
Write a C program, that opens a file for writing, closes the standard output, duplicates the descriptor of the opened file and writes on the standard output. What's the result?
Write a C program, that receives a list of file names in the command line and outputs appropriately the stat information for each of them.
