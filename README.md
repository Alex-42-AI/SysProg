An operating system is a set of grograms, which coordinate the work of computer hardware and software. The system usually provides for the following functionalities:

Input/Output
Input-output operations are essential for the work of a computer. THey allow it to store and extract data on discs or strips, to interract with customer terminals and to print out output data on paper. Each operating system must provide for some data input/output.
Command interpreter
The command interpreter reads the commands the user inputs from the terminal and translates (interprets) them into instructions the computer can execute. Command interpreters are different for different operating systems, but are an essential part for each of them.
Data control
Data control allows data organization in logical structures, called files. Despite the fact, that not all operating systems provide for data control, the ones that don't are strongly limited in terms of using them.
Tools for program development
Tools for programs development help writing and maintaining programs. This cathegory involves compilers, interpreters, assemblers, setting tools and systems for software maintainance.
Time division
Time division is a way to provide for several users to execute programs from different terminals simoltaneously. This characteristic is only typical for bigger operating systems.
Information protection
The main functionality of protection is limiting access to a user's computer and data to unauthorized users, as well as preventing misconduct on their part.
Communications
Communications regard the capability of a computer to interract with other computers or terminals about transfering programs or data.
Registration (log)
Registration keeps track of what each user has executer with their computer and supplied data.
